# TTree::MakeClass
Code generated by [this tutorial](https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/Trees.html#using-ttreemakeclass), adapted for our root file.

It uses the MakeClass method to generate an appropriate header for our root file where it lists all the branches and leaf types. Furthermore, it generates a loop skeleton which we use to generate histograms using data from the root file.

To generate the header and the loop we do the following:

- Initialize root file
```
TFile *ff = new TFile("analysis_SUSYZHZToAllToAATo4B_M15.root")
```
- Get a pointer to the TTree
```
TTree *tt = (TTree *)ff->Get("mainNtuplizer/data;1")
```
- Use the MakeClass command to generate the desirable files
```
tt->MakeClass("MyClass")
```

## Update
We update the MyClass.C such that it outputs a root file consisting of the histograms generated. We then use another macro to plot the histograms.

The three macros do the following:

- `ph_simple.C`: Hard coded - opens the `histograms.root` root file and plots the histograms.
- `print_histos.C`: Automatic plotting: Opens the file `histograms.root`, detects the histograms and plots everything. **File opened with pointer**
- `print_histos_2.C`: same as `print_histos.C` but the file is opened with `TFile ff("histograms.root")`. We used `hh[i]->SetDirectory(0)` to keep the histos alive.
